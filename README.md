## Instructions

### npm install
  - So you can get the dependencies to run the api calls

### play around
  - I made these examples as simple as possible to demonstrate the basic concepts of each. 
  - Although I used api calls for my async functions any asyncronous functions should work in these instances. If you're working with promises/async await just remember that your async function has to also be able to return a resolved promise.
